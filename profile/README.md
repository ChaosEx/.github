Eclipse Platform defines the set of frameworks and common services that collectively make up infrastructure required to support the use of Eclipse as a component model, as a Rich Client Platform (RCP) and as a comprehensive tool integration platform. These services and frameworks include a standard workbench user interface model and portable native widget toolkit, a project model for managing resources, automatic resource delta management for incremental compilers and builders, language-independent debug infrastructure, and infrastructure for distributed multi-user versioned resource management.

## Reporting issues

Please bear in mind that this project is almost entirely developed by volunteers. If you do not provide the fix/implementation yourself (or pay someone to do it for you), the bug might never get fixed. If it is a serious bug, other people than you might care enough to provide a fix.

The Eclipse Platform project is split into multiple [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-platform/repositories) owned by this organization. If you face an issue and have a sense of which particular GitHub repository is most related, you can open your issue against that repository. If you are unsure, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/.github/issues) against this repository and the issue will then be moved as best by maintainers.

For errors please provide Stacktrace or [minimal reproducer](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

For performance issues attach sampling snapshot (for example with [visualvm](https://visualvm.github.io/download.html)).
